The nPuzzle solver takes only accepts positive integer input. After each input integer always ENTER. 


If you change your mind on your input digit, you can delete it before ENTER-ing and replace it with another.


Inputting 1 when initially prompted to select a puzzle will allow you to select a puzzle ranging in difficulty 1-8. Follow the proeecding instructions.


Inputting 2 when initially prompted to select a puzzle will begin input for a custom 3x3 nPuzzle, 1 row at a time. ENTER after each input digit. If you make a mistake and create an invalid puzzle, you can end early by CTRL C or else the program will explore the entire search space and return no solution.


Inputting a custom nPuzzle will look like this in the terminal:
